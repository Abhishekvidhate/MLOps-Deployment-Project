# Steps for Project

## 1. Fine-Tune BLOOM model ( hugging face ) for my task 
## 2. convert BLOOM's Pytorch implementation into tensorflow implementation or tensorflow model
## 3. use this TF model in TFX pipeline ( all componentss in TFX from data ingestion if needed to model serving )
## 4.1 Deploy model in real-time ( in my PC for once--> demo video )
## 4.2 Deploy in cloud for free tier ( google cloud platform/ kubernete( GKE) )
## 5. create Web Application for model serving ( deployed on cloud for free , make demo video )
## 6.1 documentation and license
## 6.2 create Docker Image and other developer tools for other contributors to improve this project
## 7. Iterate and improve
