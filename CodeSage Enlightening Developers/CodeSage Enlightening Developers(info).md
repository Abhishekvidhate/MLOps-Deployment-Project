## Project Overview

 ***  Objective: Create a chat-bot that combines the precision of a custom-trained model (using TensorFlow Extended) for coding-related queries with the versatility of OpenAI’s ChatGPT for broader topics.
 
 *** Workflow: We’ll integrate TFX and ChatGPT to handle user interactions seamlessly.
 
 *** Deployment: The chat-bot will be deployed for production, allowing developers to seek answers and code references.
 
 *** Steps to Create CodeSage
Project Setup and Repository Creation:
Create a GitHub repository for your project.
Clone the repository to your local machine.

 *** Data Collection (Optional):
Collect relevant coding-related data (e.g., Stack Overflow posts, tutorials).
Preprocess and clean the data if needed.

 *** ChatGPT Integration:
Sign up for an API key from OpenAI.
Familiarize yourself with the ChatGPT API documentation.

 *** Model Development with TFX:
Develop a TFX pipeline for coding-related queries.
Train a model using TFX components (data ingestion, preprocessing, training, evaluation).
TFX Pipeline Modification:
Extend the TFX pipeline to include a ChatGPT component.
Define how the pipeline transitions between TFX and ChatGPT based on user input.

 *** User Interaction Flow:
Handle user queries:
If coding-related, route to TFX.
If general, send to ChatGPT via the API.
Combine responses appropriately.

 *** Deployment:
Deploy the TFX model using components like Pusher and InfraValidator.
Set up a production environment (e.g., Google Cloud AI Platform, Kubernetes).
Integrate ChatGPT API calls in your application code.

 *** Testing and Monitoring:
Unit test TFX and ChatGPT components.
Monitor model performance, API usage, and user interactions.
Implement fallback mechanisms for inaccurate ChatGPT responses.

 *** Documentation and Deployment Scripts:
Write clear documentation on running the pipeline, deploying the model, and interacting with the chat-bot.
Create deployment scripts or CI/CD pipelines.

 *** contribution or development :
  create docker image , for other developers to set-up locally and contribute to codesage
  
 *** Iterate and Improve:
Collect user feedback and continuously enhance both the TFX model and ChatGPT integration.
