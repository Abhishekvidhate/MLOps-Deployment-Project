# MLOps-Deployment-Project
my 1st projects implementing complete workflow of ML Project ( from data collection/ingestion to real-time inference/ deployment )

## projects :
 - Question-Answer Chat-bot for Developers :- similar to what ChatGPT or any LLM provides , aim for this repo is for me to refine my ML Project Deployment Skills
 - Chat-bot UI for ATVM :- ATVM is innovative technoloy, I want to contribute in improving user experience by simplying UI of ATVM machine ( ATVM is complex for most of railways passenger ) , simple to use chat-bot with voice, text support can be helpful in providing better UX by helping them purchase ticket in text prompt or one voice message

## Deployment frameworks :
 -  [TensorFlow Extended]([https://www.google.com](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx)) :-TensorFlow Extended (TFX) is a powerful framework designed for scalable, high-performance machine learning pipelines, enabling efficient deployment of pre-trained transformer models like BERT for tasks such as sentiment analysis and entity extraction

   A TFX pipeline is a sequence of components that implement an ML pipeline which is specifically designed for scalable, high-performance machine learning tasks. Components are built using TFX libraries which can also be used individually.
 - [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/) :-LangChain is an open-source framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using large language models (LLMs), providing a standard interface for chains, integrations with other tools, and end-to-end solutions for common applications
